<h3>Position Restrictions Policy</h3>

<h4> Summary</h4>

<p>The vZBW ARTCC utilizes position restrictions to ensure that both pilots and controllers in our airspace have a positive and enjoyable online experience. These restrictions are applied to all who control in Boston ARTCC airspace, regardless of controller rating or assigned ARTCC/Division.</p>

<p>The vZBW ARTCC currently has one designated Major airport/airspace with associated facilities and positions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Boston Logan International Airport</li>
  <li>Boston TRACON (A90)</li>
</ul>
<p>These field(s) and associated positions will require additional training and certification before a controller will be authorized to work in a solo capacity at that position.</p>
<p>Any controller wishing to control within ZBW airspace must be listed on our roster as either a full ARTCC member or Visiting Controller. To gain Visiting Controller status within vZBW, please see the <a href="/controllers/visiting-transfer">vZBW Visiting Controllers Policy</a>.</p>

<p>At your discretion, you may choose to enroll in the Minor Track or the Major Track.  The Major Track allows you to control our Major airfields and/or airspace. Currently, Boston (KBOS/A90) is our only airfield/airspace designated as Major airspace.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Any controller wishing to control any Center/Enroute position in vZBW must join and complete the Major Track, as the CTR position involves working all major positions.</strong></p>

<p>vZBW position restrictions and certifications are based on demonstrated performance rather than controller rating. This more closely mirrors real-world controller certification and should allow each controller to progress according to his ability.</p>
<h4>Position Restrictions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Controllers must earn specific vZBW certifications to work airports/airspace within vZBW</li>
<li>Controllers with the rating of S1 (or above), being a full member or visiting the vZBW ARTCC, once earning the vZBW Class C/D DEL/GND certification, may control any Delivery or Ground position within the ZBW ARTCC with the exception of KBOS.
  <ul>
    <li>If enrolled in the Major track, the controller, upon passing the Advanced Delivery/Ground exam and successfully completing familiarization training at KBOS, will be eligible to control at KBOS during off-peak times only. Your instructor/mentor must specifically grant this authorization.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Controllers with the rating of S2 (or above), being a full member or visiting the vZBW ARTCC, once earning the vZBW Class C/D TWR certification, may control any Delivery, Ground or Tower position within the ZBW ARTCC with the exception of KBOS.
  <ul>
    <li>If enrolled in the Major track, the controller, upon passing the Advanced Local exam and successfully completing familiarization training at KBOS, will be eligible to control at KBOS during off-peak times only. Your instructor/mentor must specifically grant this authorization.</li>

<li>Controllers with the rating of S3 (or above), being a full member or visiting the vZBW ARTCC, once earning the vZBW Class C APP certification, may control any Delivery, Ground, Tower or Approach position within the ZBW ARTCC with the exception of KBOS/A90.  Exception:  Controller may control ONLY the MHT_APP sector of A90, whether or not BOS_APP is online.  Controller MAY NOT provide service in the BOS_APP sectors.
  <ul>
    <li>If enrolled in the Major track, the controller, upon passing the Advanced Approach exam and successfully completing familiarization training at A90, will be eligible to control at KBOS during off-peak times only. Your instructor/mentor must specifically grant this authorization.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>A controller with no vZBW-specific certifications may not work any position without the consent of a Mentor/Instructor (who must be present).
  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>vZBW Training Program Position Restrictions</h4>
<p>All controllers are welcome and encouraged to join the vZBW Training program. vZBW's training program is robust and in-depth and will provide an excellent and rewarding challenge to the controller. Having a vZBW certification means that, as a controller, you will be recognized as having an exceptional knowledge and skill with ATC procedures. You will also find a great sense of community within the vZBW training program, as everyone is there to help each other. The detailed <a href="/controllers/training-outline">training outline</a> can be found on our website. Any controller joining the vZBW Training program will agree to be bound by the following position restrictions:</p>

<p><strong>General Conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This policy is in force at all times. However, working time is divided into <strong>PEAK</strong> and <strong>OFF-PEAK</strong> periods, all defined in terms of Boston local time (EST/EDT).</li>
<li>The term "controller" as it is used in the policy refers to any member of the Boston ARTCC regardless of their rating or certifications.</li>
<li><strong>PEAK</strong> periods are 1900-2200 Monday-Thursday and 1600-2200 Friday-Sunday.</li>
<li><strong>OFF-PEAK</strong> periods are all other times.</li>
<li>Fly-ins, Fly-outs and Events may be (and are typically) designated <strong>PEAK</strong> times. These include, but are not limited to, VATSIM/VATCAN/VATUSA events, Regional Nights, neighboring ARTCC events etc. Such designations are typically communicated via the Event Planning Forum.</li>
<li>During <strong>PEAK</strong> times, a controller is restricted to working at or below the level for which he has received certification unless there is a Mentor/Instructor present for the purposes of training.</li>
<li>During <strong>OFF-PEAK</strong> times, a controller may be granted certification to control a position without the presence of a Mentor/Instructor.</li>
<li>Controllers with no vZBW-specific certifications may not work any position unless in the presence of a mentor or instructor. The intent of this requirement is to be sure that the controllers are taught good habits early on in training and to help them achieve certification quickly.</li>
<li>All Certification OTS examinations will be conducted at any position chosen (by the mentor/instructor) either online or in the Sweatbox.</li>
<li>The vZBW ARTCC Air Traffic Manager, Deputy Air Traffic Manager, Training Administrator and all Staff Instructors reserve the right to make exceptions to these rules on a student by student basis if necessary. Mentors can recommend an exception to be made.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Positions for Certification</strong></p>
<p>Certification will be achieved via oral testing and online observation by a mentor or instructor at each of the following positions. Here is the list of current vZBW certifications. Please note that these certifications are in order from least permissive to most permissive. In other words, if you are certified for Class C APP, you may also work TWR, GND and DEL at any Class C/D facility.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Track</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class C/D DEL/GND</strong>: Allows the controller to control any Class C or Class D airport at the Delivery or Ground position at all times.</li>
<li><strong>Class C/D TWR</strong>: Allows the controller to control any Class C or Class D airport at the Tower position or below, at all times. </li>
<li><strong>Class C APP</strong>: Allows the controller to control any Class C TRACON at the Approach position or below (including Class D airports), at all times.. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Track</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Class B DEL/GND</strong>: Allows the controller to control any airport, including KBOS, at the Delivery or Ground position at all times.</li>
  <li><strong>Class B TWR</strong>: Allows the controller to control any airport, including KBOS, at the Tower position or below, at all times.</li>
  <li><strong>Class B APP</strong>: Allows the controller to control any TRACON, including A90, at the Approach position or below (including Class C/D airspace/airports), at all times.</li>
  <li><strong>Center/Enroute</strong>: Allows the controller to control BOS_CTR at all times</li>
</ul>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Noncompliance</h4>
<p>Any controller found controlling any position within vZBW without the required certifications will be asked to and should disconnect from that position, and reconnect at a position they are certified for. Refusal to do so will result in a Supervisor being called and a possible disconnection from the network with a referral to DCRM (Conflict Resolution) and possible disciplinary action. Controllers found to be repeatedly connecting at positions they are not certified for will be referred to the ATM and DATM and possible referral to DCRM.</p>
